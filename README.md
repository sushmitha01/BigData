# Project Idea
The project aims to perform an extensive analysis of YouTube channels, focusing
on vital indicators such as subscribers, video views, content categories, and
geographical distribution

# Tools
Jupyter Notebook : for documentation, code execution, and visualization, providing
                   a flexible environment for data exploration.
Microsoft Excel: Spreadsheet program.
Pyspark: Python API for distributed computing.
Tableau: Data visualization tool.
GIT: Git Version control systems like Git may be employed to manage code changes
     collaboratively.

# Goals 
1. Identify Channels with a High Variation in Monthly Earnings
2. Evaluate how efficiently each video generates revenue based on
   views.
3. Channels with High Engagement Relative to Subscribers
4. Analyze the performance of various channel categories by assessing
   the total number of video views they generated in the last
   30 days.
5. Average Views per Video for Top 3 Education Channels
6. Top 5 Channels with the Most Monthly Earnings per Video
7. Identify channels that have experienced substantial growth over
    the past year by analyzing the percentage change in subscribers
8. Channels with the Highest Subscribers-to-Views Ratio.

# Conclusion

The "Unraveling YouTube Channel Dynamics" project systematically analyzes data to uncover patterns in YouTube channel success. 
It identifies high-earning channels, evaluates subscriber engagement, and assesses content category performance using a meticulous, iterative approach. 
The high-level architecture ensures efficiency, quality, and security in data analysis, laying the foundation for future implementations.
